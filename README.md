**Spirent Automation**

**Description:** 
The Spirent Automation application aims to make Spirent testing a one click process.  With configuration and implementation performed in the application, the user only needs to scan their shop order in the proper patch and start the test with a click of a button.
The application will verify online ports, execute Spirent test script functions and report results.  
The application uses [flet](https://flet.dev/docs/) for it's front end to easily integrate with the python backend.
